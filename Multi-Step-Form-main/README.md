# Multi-Step Form Working 🚶‍♂️📝

The **Multi-Step Form** provides a seamless experience by breaking a long form into smaller, manageable sections. Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Personal Information 👤
- **Fields**: Full Name, Email
- **Functionality**:
  - Users are prompted to enter their **Full Name** and **Email**.
  - After filling in these fields, users click **Next** ▶️ to move to the next step. If any field is missing, the user will be prompted to fill it before proceeding.

### Step 2: Address 🏠
- **Fields**: Address, City
- **Functionality**:
  - In this step, users enter their **Address** and **City**.
  - Once all fields are filled, users can either click **Next** ▶️ to move forward or **Previous** ⬅️ to go back and edit the first step.
  
### Step 3: Confirmation ✅
- **Fields**: Review of the information entered in Step 1 and Step 2.
- **Functionality**:
  - This step displays a summary of the data entered in the previous steps for review 🔍.
  - Users can confirm the information and click **Submit** 📤 to finalize the form.
  - The **Previous** ⬅️ button lets users go back and edit any information before submission.

### Navigation 🔄
- **Next** ▶️: Moves users to the next step if all required fields in the current step are validated.
- **Previous** ⬅️: Allows users to go back and edit their information in the previous step.

### Form Validation ✔️
- Each step has built-in validation to ensure that users fill out all required fields. If a required field is missing ❌, the user cannot proceed until the field is completed.

### Review Process 📋
- In Step 3, a summary of the entered data is displayed for the user to confirm. If any details need to be changed 🔄, users can go back and edit the relevant fields.
